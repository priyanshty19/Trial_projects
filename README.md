### Logistic regression ##### is a statistical model that in its basic form uses a logistic function to model a binary dependent variable, although many more complex extensions exist. In regression analysis, logistic regression(or logit regression) is estimating the parameters of a logistic model (a form of binary regression).

### Linear regression ##### is a linear approach to modeling the relationship between a scalar response (or dependent variable) and one or more explanatory variables (or independent variables). The case of one explanatory variable is called simple linear regression.

##### In pattern recognition, the ### k-nearest neighbors algorithm (k-NN) ##### is a non-parametric method proposed by Thomas Cover used for classification and regression.In both cases, the input consists of the k closest training examples in the feature space.

### Decision tree ##### is a decision support tool that uses a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences, including chance event outcomes, resource costs, and utility. It is one way to display an algorithm that only contains conditional control statements.

### Random forests or random decision forests ##### are an ensemble learning method for classification, regression and other tasks that operate by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean/average prediction (regression) of the individual trees.Random decision forests correct for decision trees' habit of overfitting to their training set.

### Support vector machine (SVM) ##### is a supervised machine learning model that uses classification algorithms for two-group classification problems. After giving an SVM model sets of labeled training data for each category, theyâ€™re able to categorize new text.
